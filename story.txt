Once upon a time, in the magical land of Kingtoria, there was a beautiful princess named Jessica locked up in a lonely castle,
guarded by a powerful dragon named Parthax. The king of Kingtoria, missing his daughter Jessica, tasked the brave Sir Robin 
of Camelot to rescue her from her prison. While this was no small task, Sir Robin was up for the challenge. So he gathered up 
a crew of bards and servants and headed to the forsaken castle to face Parthax. On the way, the bards sang many verses about
Sir Robin's many conquests: 
"Bravely bold Sir Robin
Rode forth from Camelot.
He was not afraid to die,
Oh brave Sir Robin.
He was not at all afraid
To be killed in nasty ways.
Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin."
